A starter project for Bloc's jQuery-driven music player app.

Goals were: 
  -  to find the pros and cons of using a helper library
  -  using jQuery selectors correctly and understanding the object(s) returned

I assembled this player using jQuery. I've learned that jQuery is both efficient and imperative to learn as a developer.
